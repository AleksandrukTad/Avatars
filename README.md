# Avatars

## Description
For this project I used my basic [boilerplate](https://github.com/AleksandrukTad/FullstackFramework) framework for TypeScript, Styled-components, NextJS, ReactJS and Jest. Unfortunatelly its not finished yet so you cannot build production, running development server works fine. For state management I used Easy-peasy which is library that uses Redux, but handles all setup. 

## Setup the project
-Clone the repo <br />
-Make sure that Typescript is installed as global <br />
-install all the node modules from package.json by running `npm i` <br />
-run server `npm run dev` <br />
## Commands
To run server: `npm run dev` <br />
To run tests: `npm run test` <br />
To run tslint: `npm run tslint` <br />
